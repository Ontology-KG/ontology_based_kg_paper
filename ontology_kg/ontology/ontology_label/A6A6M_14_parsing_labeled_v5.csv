4757,5,1035,"X1.1 Continuous wide hot strip rolling mills are normally equipped with coilers. Regardless of the different types of systems employed during or following the rolling operations, it is common for the steel to be reeled into the coiler at temperatures in the stress-relieving range. In general, such temperatures are higher as the steel thickness increases. The coils subsequently cool to ambient temperature with outer and inner laps cooling more rapidly than central laps. The differ- ence in cooling rate can result in measurable differences in the mechanical properties throughout a coil. Data confirm reduced yield and tensile strength with increased percent elongation for the steel with slower cooling rates from the coiling temperature to ambient. Such differences are in addition to the effects on mechanical properties caused by differences in heat analysis and chemical segregation.",60,63,"[31.431, 166.8940478515625, 282.907, 255.87304785156243]",system,2025-08-14 01:29:52.225517,system,2025-08-14 01:29:52.225517,text,False,APPENDIXES,X1 COIL AS A SOURCE OF STRUCTURAL PRODUCTS,,,False,,,text

Such testing procedures are not intended to define the upper or lower limits of tensile properties at all possible test locations within a heat of steel. It is well known and documented that tensile properties will vary within a heat or individual piece of steel as a function of chemical composition, processing, testing procedure and other factors. It is, therefore, incumbent on designers and engineers to use sound engineering judgement when using tension test results shown on mill test reports.
